**Example Usage:**
```
LLM: Let me get your current Motion context to understand your situation.
Tool: get_motion_context
Result: You're in "Development" workspace with 15 active tasks. You have 3 overdue tasks and 5 high-priority items. Recent activity shows focus on "API Integration" project.
Suggestions:
- Address 3 overdue tasks (Task A, B, C)
- Continue work on high-priority "Security Review"
- Upcoming deadline: "Release Planning" due tomorrow
```

### Intelligent Search
The `search_motion_content` tool provides semantic search capabilities:

**Advanced Search Features:**

**Analytics Capabilities:**
- Task distribution by status, priority, and project
- Overdue task identification and counting
- Upcoming deadline tracking and alerts
- Project health and progress monitoring
- Time-based analysis (today, this week, this month)

**Example Usage:**
```

Tool: analyze_motion_workload
Args: {"timeframe": "this_week", "includeProjects": true}
Result: Workload Analysis (this_week):
- Total Tasks: 23
- Overdue Tasks: 3

- Task ID: task_456 -> 9:00 AM (ASAP priority)
- Task ID: task_789 -> 10:30 AM (Due today)
- Task ID: task_012 -> 2:00 PM (HIGH priority)
```

### Workflow Intelligence
The `suggest_next_actions` tool provides proactive assistance:

**Smart Suggestions Based On:**
- Current task priorities and deadlines
- Project status and momentum
- Historical patterns and preferences
- Workload balance and capacity
- Context-aware recommendations (daily planning, project review, etc.)

**Example Usage:**
```
LLM: What should I focus on next?
Tool: suggest_next_actions
Args: {"context": "daily planning", "maxSuggestions": 3}
Result: Suggested Next Actions:
‚úÖ Complete "Security Review" (task_789) - ASAP priority, due today
‚è∞ Start "Database Migration" (task_456) - Due in 2 days
üîÑ Review stalled project: "Mobile App" - No recent activity
```

## Quick Start for LLM Context

**For optimal LLM assistance, start with these tools:**

1. **`get_motion_context`** - Get comprehensive workspace overview and current state
2. **`analyze_motion_workload`** - Understand current workload and priorities
3. **`suggest_next_actions`** - Get AI-powered recommendations for what to focus on next

**Example Intelligent Workflow:**
```
User: "Help me plan my day"

LLM: I'll help you plan your day efficiently. Let me first understand your current situation.

1. Getting your Motion context...
Tool: get_motion_context
Result: You're in "Work" workspace with 12 active tasks, 2 overdue items, and 4 high-priority tasks.

2. Analyzing your current workload...
Tool: analyze_motion_workload
Args: {"timeframe": "today"}
Result: Today you have 6 tasks, 2 are overdue, 3 due by end of day.

3. Generating smart suggestions...
Tool: suggest_next_actions
Args: {"context": "daily planning"}
Result: Recommended focus:
- ‚úÖ Complete overdue "Security Review" (ASAP priority)
- ‚è∞ Finish "Database Migration" (due today)
- üöÄ Start "Feature Testing" (high priority, good momentum)

Based on this analysis, I recommend starting with the overdue Security Review task since it's marked ASAP priority, then moving to the Database Migration that's due today. This will clear your urgent items and give you momentum for the day.

Would you like me to help schedule these tasks or create any new tasks for your day?
```

## Error Handling & Logging

The server includes comprehensive error handling and MCP-compliant logging:

### MCP-Compliant Logging
- **Structured JSON logs** to stderr for MCP compliance
- **Detailed context** including method names, IDs, and API responses
- **Error tracking** with API status codes and messages
- **Performance monitoring** with request/response timing

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Smart workspace resolution** with fallback to defaults
- **Project lookup validation** with helpful error messages
- **API response structure handling** for wrapped/unwrapped responses
- **Input validation** with detailed parameter requirements
- **Graceful degradation** when optional features fail

### Error Response Examples
```json
// Missing workspace error
{"error": "workspaceId is required and no default workspace could be found"}

// Project not found error
{"error": "Project 'Marketing Campaign' not found in workspace"}

// Invalid parameter error
{"error": "Task priority must be one of: ASAP, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW"}
```

## Security

- API keys are never logged or exposed
- All sensitive information is kept out of logs
- Input validation on all endpoints
- MCP-compliant structured logging to stderr
- Workspace-scoped operations for data isolation

## Architecture

The Motion MCP Server is designed as a focused MCP implementation:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-server.js     # MCP protocol server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ motionApi.js  # Enhanced Motion API service layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/            # Utility functions
```

### Key Components

**MotionApiService (`motionApi.js`):**
- **Smart workspace detection** with default workspace resolution
- **Project lookup by name** with fuzzy matching capabilities
- **Enhanced error handling** with detailed context and fallbacks
- **MCP-compliant logging** with structured JSON output
- **API response handling** for Motion's wrapped response formats

**MCP Server (`mcp-server.js`):**
- **Intelligent parameter resolution** for workspace and project names
- **Enhanced tool definitions** with comprehensive parameter documentation
- **Robust error handling** with user-friendly error messages
- **Workspace-aware operations** for all project and task management

## Recent Improvements

- **Response Handling**: Fixed array method errors by properly handling wrapped API responses

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### MCP Logging
The server outputs structured JSON logs to stderr for debugging:
```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Successfully fetched projects","method":"getProjects","count":3,"workspaceId":"ws_123","time":"2025-05-26T22:30:45.123Z"}
{"level":"error","msg":"Failed to create task","method":"createTask","error":"workspaceId is required","time":"2025-05-26T22:30:46.456Z"}
```

### Common Issues

**Task Creation Fails:**
- Ensure your Motion API key has task creation permissions
- Check that the workspace exists and is accessible
- Verify project names are spelled correctly (uses fuzzy matching)

**Workspace Not Found:**
- List workspaces first with `list_motion_workspaces`
- Use exact workspace names or IDs
- Check API key permissions for workspace access

**Project Resolution Issues:**
- Projects are searched within the specified workspace only
- Use partial names for fuzzy matching: "Marketing" will find "Marketing Campaign"
- Ensure the project exists in the target workspace

### Debugging Tips
1. **Check stderr output** for detailed MCP logs
2. **Use `list_motion_workspaces`** to see available workspaces
3. **Test with simple task creation** before using advanced parameters
4. **Verify API key permissions** in Motion settings

## How MCP Communication Works

1. **LLM Discovery**: LLM calls `tools/list` to discover available tools
2. **Tool Schema**: Server returns JSON schemas for each tool
3. **Tool Execution**: LLM calls `tools/call` with tool name and arguments
4. **Response**: Server executes Motion API call and returns structured result

**Example Protocol Flow:**
```json
// LLM requests available tools
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}

// Server responds with tool definitions
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": {"tools": [...]}}

// LLM calls a tool
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call",
 "params": {"name": "create_motion_task", "arguments": {...}}}

// Server executes and responds
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "result": {"content": [...]}}
```
