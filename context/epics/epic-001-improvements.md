# EPIC-001: Motion MCP Server Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the Motion MCP Server to enhance stability, complete API coverage, and improve developer experience.

## Objective
Transform the Motion MCP Server from a functional prototype into a production-ready, fully-featured integration that covers all Motion API capabilities with robust error handling and excellent documentation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All Motion API endpoints implemented and functional
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- [ ] Input validation on all user-facing operations
- [ ] Complete documentation with examples
- [ ] Type safety throughout the codebase
- [ ] Efficient caching layer for performance
- [ ] Tool count optimized below 100
- [ ] Issue #4 (JSON error) resolved

## Features

### F01: Error Handling & Stability
- **Priority**: HIGH (addresses Issue #4)
- **Tasks**: 6
- **Status**: Ready to start

### F02: API Completeness
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Tasks**: 7
- **Status**: Ready after F01

### F03: Documentation & Usability
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Tasks**: 2
- **Status**: Ready after core features

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: F01 - Error Handling & Stability (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: F02 - API Completeness (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: F03 - Documentation & Usability (Week 5)

## Dependencies
- Motion API documentation
- TypeScript foundation (COMPLETE)
- Tool consolidation (COMPLETE)
- MCP SDK and protocol specifications

## Risks
- API rate limiting may affect testing
- Some Motion API endpoints may have undocumented behaviors
- Tool count limitations in MCP protocol

## Status
ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress** - Foundation complete, starting feature development

## Notes
- Issue #4 needs immediate attention
- Consider creating integration tests early
- Document API responses as we implement
