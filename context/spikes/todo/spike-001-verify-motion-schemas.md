# Spike 001: Verify Motion Schemas and Interfaces

## Metadata
- **Type**: Investigation
- **Priority**: üü† High - Critical for API reliability
- **Time Box**: 6 hours maximum
- **Created**: 2025-08-15
- **Owner**: Developer
- **Status**: TODO

## Context
The Motion MCP Server implements 18+ API endpoints with TypeScript interfaces and schemas, but there may be misalignment between our type definitions and the actual Motion API documentation. This could lead to runtime errors, data loss, or unexpected behavior when the API returns different field structures than we expect.

Recent work has revealed potential gaps:
- Task 006 fixed MotionStatus interface mismatches
- Several APIs added recently (schedules, custom fields, recurring tasks) need verification
- Complex nested objects (chunks, assignees, projects) may have incomplete typing
- Response validation is in place but may be lenient about missing/extra fields

## Related Items
- Feature: API Completeness (epic-001-f02)
- Issue: Potential schema mismatches causing runtime errors
- Context: All recently implemented APIs need verification

## Questions to Answer

### Primary Questions
- [ ] Do our MotionTask, MotionProject, MotionWorkspace interfaces match the actual API responses?
- [ ] Are all required fields properly marked as required vs optional in our interfaces?
- [ ] Do our create/update data interfaces include all available API parameters?

### Secondary Questions
- [ ] Are there missing fields in newer API implementations (schedules, custom fields, recurring tasks)?
- [ ] Do our enum values (priority, frequency, etc.) match the API's accepted values?
- [ ] Are our nested object interfaces (chunks, assignees, etc.) complete and accurate?
- [ ] Do our error response interfaces match actual API error structures?

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All primary questions have documented answers
- [ ] Complete audit of all 18+ API endpoints against official documentation
- [ ] List of identified schema mismatches with severity assessment
- [ ] Recommendations for fixing critical and high-priority issues
- [ ] Time box was respected (‚â§6 hours)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Comprehensive schema audit report
- [ ] Prioritized list of schema fixes needed
- [ ] Updated interfaces/schemas for critical issues
- [ ] Documentation of API field mappings and discrepancies

## Investigation Plan

### Approach
1. **Document Current State** (1h)
   - Catalog all Motion API endpoints we're calling
   - List all current TypeScript interfaces and schemas
   - Document validation configurations

2. **Motion API Documentation Review** (2h)
   - Access official Motion API documentation
   - Document actual API response structures for each endpoint
   - Note required vs optional fields, data types, enum values

3. **Schema Comparison Analysis** (2h)
   - Compare our interfaces field-by-field with API docs
   - Identify missing fields, incorrect types, wrong optionality
   - Check create/update parameter completeness

4. **Validation & Recommendations** (1h)
   - Categorize issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Create fix recommendations with effort estimates
   - Update critical schemas if time permits

### Resources to Consult
- Motion API Official Documentation (https://docs.usemotion.com/api)
- Current TypeScript interfaces in src/types/motion.ts
- API validation schemas in src/schemas/motion.ts
- Actual API responses from existing implementations

### Tools/Methods
- Motion API documentation portal
- Manual schema comparison spreadsheet/table
- TypeScript compiler for validation
- API testing with real requests where possible

## üìù FINDINGS (To be filled during spike)

### Current API Endpoints Catalog
<!-- List all 18+ endpoints we're calling with their HTTP methods -->

### Schema Audit Results
<!-- Field-by-field comparison results -->

### Critical Issues Found
<!-- High-priority schema mismatches that could cause runtime errors -->

### Documentation Gaps Identified
<!-- Areas where Motion API docs are unclear or incomplete -->

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

### Summary
<!-- One paragraph summary of findings and recommended approach -->

### Priority Fixes Needed
<!-- Categorized list of schema updates required -->

### Implementation Strategy
<!-- Recommended approach for fixing identified issues -->

### Pros
- Improved type safety and runtime reliability
- Better developer experience with accurate interfaces
- Reduced risk of API integration bugs
- Enhanced validation coverage

### Cons
- Time investment required for thorough fixes
- Potential breaking changes to existing code
- May require updating multiple interface files

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Status Quo** - Keep current schemas - Risk: Runtime errors, data inconsistencies
2. **Gradual Updates** - Fix only critical issues - Risk: Partial improvements only
3. **Complete Overhaul** - Rewrite all schemas - Risk: High effort, potential new bugs

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Review and prioritize identified schema issues
- [ ] Create tasks for high-priority schema fixes
- [ ] Update validation configuration if needed

### Follow-up Tasks to Create
- **Fix Critical Schema Issues** (Est: 4-6h) - Update interfaces for runtime-critical mismatches
- **Complete Schema Alignment** (Est: 8-12h) - Comprehensive update of all interfaces
- **Enhanced Validation Rules** (Est: 2-4h) - Strengthen response validation based on findings
- **API Documentation Updates** (Est: 2h) - Update internal docs with discovered API details

### Knowledge Base Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with schema verification process
- [ ] Document Motion API field mappings in context/
- [ ] Add schema validation guidelines to conventions.md

### Technical Debt Items
- Incomplete type coverage for nested objects
- Missing validation for some API responses
- Potential enum value mismatches
- Create/update parameter completeness gaps
