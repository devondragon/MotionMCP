## Summary
Working on Motion MCP Server improvements, specifically task-002 for input validation after completing task-001 (Enhanced Error Handling).

## Key Decisions Made
1. Completed enhanced error handling with retry logic (task-001)
2. Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for API retries
3. Added 429 rate limit handling with Retry-After header support
4. Fixed unreachable code issue from PR review feedback
5. Successfully merged PR #13 to main branch
6. Started task-002 for input validation improvements

## Important Code Locations
- Motion API Service: `src/services/motionApi.ts`
- Constants (retry config): `src/utils/constants.ts`
- Validators (to be created): `src/utils/validators.js`
- MCP Server handlers: `src/mcp-server.js`

## Current Focus
Implementing comprehensive input validation for all Motion API calls to catch errors early and provide better user feedback.

## Recent Actions
- Created and pushed PR #13 for enhanced error handling
- Addressed Copilot's PR feedback about unreachable code
- Merged PR #13 to main branch
- Cleaned up local branches
- Created new feature branch for task-002
- Moved task-002 from todo to current directory
- Updated working state files

## Next Steps
1. Create src/utils/validators.js with validation functions
2. Apply validators to all handlers in mcp-server.js
3. Test validation with various inputs
4. Document validation rules
5. Create PR for review

## Context from Previous Work
- Task-001 added retry logic to all 12 Motion API methods
- Retry configuration: 3 attempts, 250ms initial backoff, 2x multiplier
- All API calls now handle transient failures gracefully
- Project is using TypeScript with CommonJS modules
- Following ccmagic directory structure for task organization
